            Vanilla Backgrounds Expanded is a mod that adds many new main menu and loading screen backgrounds inspired by RimWorld - all created by Oskar Potocki for the purpose of Vanilla Expanded mod series. With mod options, you will be fully able to customize what backgrounds appear in the game, whether they cycle or not, and how long should it take for them to change into other backgrounds.
            
               Modders can easily add new BackgroundDefs which will be automatically picked up by our mod options menu. 
                  
                     The background images within this mod are protected under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0. They cannot be reuploaded, modified or exploited without permission. You can, however, use them as your PC wallpaper if you want. If you're a youtuber, you can use them in your videos and youtube thumbnail images.

            A common framework to change body part max HP. (Please use HugsLib to check this mod's version.)
            
               This mod made use of the multi-version feature of RW, and therefore has compatibility with RW &lt; v1.4 in the same mod file.
                  
                     As a rule of thumb, if Ludeon did not change much about the health system, then this mod should still continue to work even though it may say "the version number does not match".

            Vanilla Expanded Framework incorporates a multitude of functionalities for different mods in order for us to boost performance by not duplicating code across several mods. Examples of shared functionality include custom base generation code with an amazing building export tool, customisable sieges, faction-based pack animal textures, faction based apparel colouring system, Orion’s Faction Discovery revamped and improved, Item processor code, shields, and many, many others.
            	
               	Orion's Faction Discovery?
                  
                     Yes!We have negotiated a deal with Orion and included his Faction Discovery mod within Vanilla Expanded Framework. Now, if you decide to add a faction to an existing playthrough, upon loading up the save you will have an option to spawn it's settlements and define how many of them you would like to spawn, as well as how far away from the player.

            Vanilla Achievements Expanded is a unique, never before seen in RimWorld modding achievement mod, part of the Vanilla Expanded mod series and a framework for other modders. 
            This mod adds an extensive achievement system, with various different stats being tracked. Players receive a pop up rewarding them for going above and beyond and pushing their boundaries. Players receive achievement points which can not only be shown off, but also can be used to fire several types of pre-existing in-game events.
               
                  Most achievement trackers (described below) can be used in xml. This means other modders can include an Achievements.xml file in their mods and inject custom, mod specific achievements into our framework. That is of course if Vanilla Achievements Expanded is active.

            Vanilla Psycasts Expanded is potentially our Magnum Opus, a greatest, most exquisite, complex and visually stunning mod up to date. As always, it started with us simply not being satisfied with how Psycasts ended up being in Royalty DLC. This resulted in us wanting to expand on the concept, and expand we did.
            	
               Inspired by games such as World of Warcraft, Stellaris, Path of Exile and many more, we have designed a brand new system that makes Psycasters truly worth-while, whilst also keeping everything anchored in the grim universe of RimWorld. This mod does not add fantasy character classes, tossing fireballs left and right, conjuring holy magic to repel demons etc. It simply expands on the mysterious psychic powers granted by the link to an archotech.
                  
                     Complex level-up system will reward you for meditating, allowing you to distribute ability points in many different paths, unlocking hundreds of new, unique abilities, each kept in line with vanilla psycasts when it comes to balancing and visuals. Ultimately, it’s up to you if you want to become a fire-slinging conflagrator, an animal ruling wildspeaker, or a mix of both. As it always is with RPG games, you can also spend level-up points on upgrading your overall psycaster stats.
                        
                           On rare occasions, enemies can send their finest psycasters against you. They will be able to use all their unlocked abilities to defeat you, so you should make sure to prioritize them. Don’t worry - Psycaster raids are rare, and the game prompts you with fair warnings that an enemy raid is utilising a psycaster.
                              
                                 If you like going balls to the wall, however, Basilicus Bestower is a new storyteller that allows any pawn to appear as a psycaster. This means you will see psycasters in almost every raid.
                                    
                                       This mod should be compatible with most of the mods, except the mods that add new psycasts or change existing ones. Please check the mod description on Steam Workshop for details into what mods are not compatible.

            Adds multiple unique new animals to Rimworld.
            
               &lt;size=24&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;
                  
                     Adds 100+ new, vanilla-friendly creatures to the diverse biomes of your Rimworlds. The philosophy of this mod is that every new creatures tries to bring some new mechanic into the game, whether it be walking tanks, living resource farm, indestructible plant monsters, night time stalkers, or plain speedy giant spiders. Some of the mechanics are simple, others much more complex.
                        
                           These animals will spawn in certain biomes, some others will only be available via traders. You'll have to explore to find them all! The Alpha Biomes is a companion mod that adds several new alien biomes to house these weird creatures.
                              
                                 Bear in mind that spawn probabilities have been calculated with no other animal mods installed. If you have, for example, Vanilla Animals Expanded, less animals from this mod will appear, obviously.
                                    
                                       The mod will also add new insects in a new faction, the Black Hive. Raids from that faction can be disabled via Mod Options.
                                          
                                             &lt;size=24&gt;Issues&lt;/size&gt;
                                                
                                                   There shouldn't be any. Balance is obviously always a concern, although it has been playtested. Feel free to tell me if you think something is too wacky.

                                                            Obviously, more animals!

            Vanilla Books Expanded is a mod allowing your colonists to pass their knowledge and skill to others. By writing a book about a particular field of science or skill, pawns will transfer their insights and knowledge, and when read, such books will train others in the same skill. Book reading is a new type of joy, with pawns picking up the books best suited for them based on their passions and skill sets, expanding on them whilst getting joy buffs.
            	
               Books feature complex descriptions, letting you, the player, know what the book is about in a funny, quirky RimWorld style. Later technologies also allow you to write newspapers, providing joy but spoiling at a rapid rate. In addition to that, maps and blueprints can be found with traders - former unlocking quests, and latter unlocking technologies!
                  
                     Books take a long time to write - no one writes a book overnight, but they increase in quality and value the more skilled your colonist is in that particular field of study. With this mod you can build massive libraries and have pawns enjoy the books in their schedule. Take a minute to read the book descriptions as we have spent dozens of hours writing up different combinations of words to make the funniest descriptions possible!

            Vanilla Cooking Expanded is a core module in a brand new mod series “Vanilla Cuisine Expanded” from the Vanilla Expanded team, notably Sarg Bjornson, Oskar Potocki and Chowder. Whilst other mods work very well without it, Vanilla Cooking Expanded makes use of fish from Vanilla Fishing Expanded as well as plants from Vanilla Plants Expanded in order to provide users with a more in-depth cooking experience.
            
               Mechanics are simple and intuitive - keeping within the vanilla spirit without the unnecessary fluff and production chains. Your colonists will be able to cook up a variety of new meal types, make mood boosting desserts out of fruits, make filling grilled meals that lose the effect when frozen, create large bakes using flour or produce large quantities of soup through boiling ingredients for several days at a time. Using our new system, you can now transform animal milk into cheese inside a cheese press - and it gains quality, and with that - value, the longer it’s inside! Yes, alongside Vanilla Factions Expanded - Medieval you can now create a cheese and wine empire! Hopefully this will provide one more reason to keep livestock!
                  
                     Our systems are heavily moddable and support a variety of pre-existing mods. With Vanilla Factions Expanded - Insectoids you can now transform insectoid milk into insectoid cheese, and thanks to Sarg Bjornson, you can now utilise 19 (!) types of milk from Alpha Animals, Vanilla Genetics Expanded and Alpha Bees to create your cheese empire!
                        
                           New ways of preserving food in the form of canning and deep frying, as well as a brand new condiment system will allow you to create not-so-filling gourmet meals that apply 12h long effects to people who consume them.

            Vanilla Fishing Expanded is a first module in a brand new mod series “Vanilla Cuisine Expanded” from the Vanilla Expanded team. With such an important mechanic missing from the base game, we Oskar and Sarg have decided to introduce a way to catch fish in your local water sources, adding a bit of purpose for settling near running water and ocean side.
            
               With simple, intuitive, vanilla-like mechanics, all it takes is to designate a fishing zone same way you designate a growing zone, and assign your Animals capable pawns to the new fishing job type. In no time they will pull out fishing rods from their invisible bags, head straight down to the river and whilst chatting to each other, try to catch a new meat type called fish, which can be eaten raw (providing an Ate raw food debuff, just like regular vanilla meat), or used in a cooking recipe. Unlike other mods, the fish don’t need to be butchered.

            Vanilla Ideology Expanded is a mini-series of mods aimed at expanding the content in ideology - be it memes, relics and symbols or icons alike.
            	
               The goal of the Memes and Structures mod is to add unique memes, and… well, structures to your game. For some reason certain obvious choices like Shinto, Taoism and Eldritch were missing from the base DLC, and this mod is here to introduce them to the ideology creation.
                  With unique memes, players will be able to diversify their playthrough every time they play. This should increase longevity of the game and also make it way more unique and personalised.
                     
                        This mod adds 36 new memes, alongside many new structures, rituals, precepts, specialist roles, items, objects and mechanics. It should greatly expand what Ideology has to offer, and meshes nicely with the rest of the DLC. With Vanilla Ideology Expanded - Memes and Structures you will be able to create powerful psykers that simply love chocolate, a corporate scrap trading business, a fishing republic, a bunch of god-king radicals, mechanoid technocratic union and much, much more.

            Adds multiple unique new biomes to Rimworld.
             
               &lt;size=24&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;
                  
                     Adds 12 new diverse biomes to your Rimworlds. The mod has been designed with the Alpha Animals mod in mind, although it is not a requirement.
                        
                           - The Mycotic Jungle: a warm and humid biome filled with HUGE mushrooms. Home to the Wildpod and some weird mushroom varieties of usual creatures.
                              - The Gallatross Graveyard: an arid temperate biome, littered with the skeletal remains of ancient beasts.
                                 - The Feralisk Infested Jungle: a warm, wet biome with incredibly dense vegetation, filled to the brink with extremely dangerous predatory spiders.
                                    - The Ocular Forest: a weird transdimensional realm intruding upon our Universe. Home to strange new flora and fauna.
                                       - The Gelatinous Superorganism: a swampy biome that is actually the upper surface of an extraordinarily large mold-like creature. No rocks to be found, but plenty of food.
                                          - The Mechanoid Intrusion: a desolate temperate biome with mechanical ruins. Apparently an ancient mechanoid attempt at turning the planet into a megastructure.
                                             - The Propane Lakes: a frozen wasteland, colder than the most inhospitable Sea Ice, but teaming with aberrant flora and fauna.
                                                - The Forsaken Crags: permanently clouded by a preternatural darkness, light is the most valuable commodity in this desertic landscape. Inspired by (and compatible with) the Forsakens mod.
                                                   - The Tar Pits: an arid biome rich in vegetation, filled with treacherous tar pits that make movement quite difficult. Beware the Bumbledrone hives! 
                                                      - The Pyroclastic Conflagration: a volcanic expanse of unrelenting and brutal nature. Fire and lava are both your worst enemy and your best friend in this biome.
                                                         - The Idyllic Meadows: a lush meadow of giant flowers. A super easy biome that provides tons of resources and few predators.
                                                            - The Miasmic Mangrove: a dangerous tropical biome full of debilitating diseases.
                                                               
                                                                  
                                                                     The biomes have been tweaked so they don't take too much space in the world map, and you might have to generate a planet again if some biome is not appearing, since they have different temperature and humidity characteristics.
                                                                        
                                                                           &lt;size=24&gt;Issues&lt;/size&gt;
                                                                              
                                                                                 Balance is obviously always a concern, although it has been playtested. Feel free to tell me if you think something is too wacky.
                                                                                    
                                                                                       &lt;size=24&gt;Plans for the future&lt;/size&gt;

            Adds extra functionality to the Animals tab

                  Does not require a new save game. 
                     Can safely be enabled/disabled in ongoing saves.

                              First released back in A12 (or was it 11?) this mod vastly improved the vanilla animals tab. Evidently, Tynan agreed and the mod is now (mostly) part of the vanilla game. I still feel this mod looks better, and adds enough extra functionality (sorting, filters, renaming) to make it a worthwhile replacement.

                                       Domestication (wildness) and the loss over training over time is not visible in the tab. I plan on adding some kind of indicator to show this, but don’t know when I’ll have time. Note that this information is also not shown in the vanilla animals tab.

                                                Gender and lifestage icons on the animals tab. Easily keep track of your chickenfarm! 
                                                   Butchery designation right from the animals tab. 
                                                      Sort by name, gender, lifestage/age, and bodysize (meat). 
                                                         Filter by race, and a variety of attributes. 
                                                            Rename (named) pets. Don’t like the name Buttercup for your Warg? Change it!

            ReGrowth: Core is both a content mod and a small framework, aiming to overhaul and improve on Rimworlds vanilla biomes, add new and unique features and biomes, replace many of the vanilla plant textures with HD ones and, in combination with its companion mods, add new plants that fit perfectly into the vanilla artstyle. On top of that, it adds a lot of new weather types, many with custom visual effects to spice up your game.
            
               ReGrowth is, at its core, a mod deeply influenced by the philosophy of the Vanilla Expanded Series. Everything it adds fits into Vanilla Rimworld. Every system (like for example new terrain) is designed to mimic how similar vanilla systems work while also being as friendly to your games performance as possible. NOTHING in this mod will absolutely tank your FPS and the few features that do cost some performance are optional.
                  
                     This mod is the Core, which is a requirement for all other ReGrowth mods. Please note the new terrain will only be seen in new biomes that use them, not in vanilla biomes.
                        
                           This mod is as lightweight as possible, adding the minimum of code required and every bit of code written has performance in mind!

            Consider inventing the humble mini-turret.
            
               In vanilla Rimworld, the process is:
                      A colonist sits in front of a research table and stares at it for five weeks. 
                     
                        
                           With Research Reinvented, the process can include any of the following:
                                  Reverse engineer existing commandeered turrets.
                                     See what you can learn from that ancient broken down security turret.
                                        Analyse raw materials for their durability as turret armor.
                                           Experiment with steel to figure out efficient barrel replacements.
                                              Test out what modifications to the standard machine pistol or autopistol design might make for the best turret weapon.
                                                 Construct a prototype turret, even if it takes longer and the end product might need some fixing up right away.
                                                
                                                   
                                                      Taking advantage of such research opportunities can significantly accelerate your research progress. However, if none are available, the fallback Theory research is equivalent in speed to vanilla research (this speed can be lowered in the mod settings, if you'd prefer an incentive to seek opportunities out).

            Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Coilguns is an addition to one of the most popular mods of Vanilla Expanded collection - Vanilla Weapons Expanded, however it can be played without it. This mod adds a selection of spacer-tech weapons, fully craftable upon researching mass drivers technology. Coilguns come with a unique gimmick - whilst their firing speed and aiming time are quite unforgiving, projectiles fires from these weapons pierce any target they hit - flesh or metal, as well as any obstacles. Each obstacle reduces damage dealt to the next unlucky object/creature, but effectively these weapons allow your colonists to score multi-kills with a single shot.
            
               Shots fired by these weapons cannot penetrate mountains or reinforced walls from Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Spacer.

               Weapons are spread across the technology tree allowing for realistic and time-consuming progression, making the higher-tech weapons even more rewarding. Bear in mind, however, that all weapons are perfectly balanced in line with Vanilla weapons, which means that a Battle Rifle added by this mod might not necessarily be better than a standard assault rifle in some situations.

            What I think this game was missing from the usual combat encounters is a punch, a smell of freshly fired bolters, the heat of an autocannon barrel and the look of surprise on the enemy faces as 10 homing missiles decimate their ranks. Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Heavy is our response to that task: This mod adds incredibly heavy weapons that can only be equipped on a handful of pawns - be it power armored troopers, pawns with a Tough trait or soldiers wearing our new industrial tech exosuits.
            
               These weapons utilise the limited-use code, just like vanilla triple rocket launcher, except they can be fired more than once. After the weapon depletes, it breaks, which means you need to simply craft a new one. No ammo system, nothing like that!

            Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Laser is an addition to one of the most popular mods of Vanilla Expanded collection - Vanilla Weapons Expanded, however it can be played without it. This mod adds a selection of ultratech weapons, with a small number of them craftable, whilst keeping the majority of them only obtainable from the enemy drops, world quests and traders. Laser weapons introduce a new projectile type - a laser beam that has a slight chance of setting the enemy on fire. These weapons have high armour piercing and are extremely effective in combat against armored enemies and mechanoids.
            
               Salvaged Laser weapons are obtainable by players using a new Salvage laser weapon recipe, which uses intellectual skill of pawns and allows them to look through advanced components to come up with a random laser weapon. Salvaged laser weapons are less accurate than their state-of-the-art ultratech counterparts, and are more prone to overheating.
                  
                     Laser weapons have a brand new warm-up mechanic making them perfect for defensive battles - the longer your pawn is stationary whilst firing, the faster the weapon can fire. Once it reaches maximum firing speed however, it can overheat, causing a small explosion with a chance of setting your pawn on fire.

            Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Quickdraw is an addition to a popular Vanilla Expanded mod series, adding four new quickdraw weapons. These firearms allow you to quickly respond to sudden enemy encounters, as special plasteel alloys allow you to reduce the aiming time to zero. There are drawbacks however - whilst these weapons fire a little bit faster than their vanilla counterparts, the cooldown after firing the shots is slightly increased.

            One of the most commonly requested features for Vanilla Factions Expanded - Settlers was tech-locking their weapons. Sadly, vanilla game does not differentiate between ‘western-style’ weapons like revolvers and M14 assault rifles - for the game, it’s all industrial weapons. If we were to white list only ‘western-style’ weapons, it wouldn’t offer enough variety - you’d constantly see raiders with revolvers, bolt action rifles and pump shotguns. That’s it. Boring isn’t it?
            
               Don’t worry fam, we got you. Hold our beer while we deliver a decent-sized weapon mod featuring vast amount of new western-style weapons with a new High roller mechanic, giving these guns a chance (10%) to deal double damage. This mod also includes a large number of conditional patches adding even more weapons - if you’re running Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Laser, you can expect some laser frontier weapons, with Heavy Weapons you can hold a gatling gun, with Coilguns you can have proper coilgun revolver and repeater, and with quickdraw you can wield a famous derringer!

            Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Makeshift is a small module that fits perfectly with all the nutters playing Naked Brutality survival scenario, or roleplaying in a post-apocalyptic universe. Inspired directly by games like Rust and Fallout, as well as the improvised firearms of the Chechen rebels, these guns can be crafted without any machining tables or steel. All you need is to complete the Makeshift weapons research project, bring your components to a crafting spot and start mass producing these cheap, unreliable weapons.
              
               That’s right. Unreliable? What does it mean? It means that each weapon has a random amount of shots it can fire within a burst (with a minimum and maximum amount). A makeshift pistol can fire between 0 (!) and 1 shots, whilst a makeshift rifle can fire anywhere between 0 and 5 shots.
                  
                     You never know how many shots your burst will fire, or if it will fire at all, thus making these weapons non-ideal. Essentially, by crafting these, you allow Randy Random to mess with you one more time during every combat encounter. But hey, they are cheap, and they are makeshift!

            Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Non-Lethal has been a commonly requested weapon set. So many times prison breaks result in accidental deaths. So many times, an enemy raider is your colonist’s father and you accidentally put a sniper rifle round through his skull. So many times your berserk pawn starts to fight with your melee expert with archotech arms, resulting in, well, death.
            
               Thanks to this mod, you will now have numerous ways of dispatching crowds and taking down single targets - you can use tear gas to blind groups of opponents, tasers to stun single targets, and dart guns to bring down even the hardest foes in a matter of seconds.

            Modifies quest rewards to focus heavily on items that cannot be crafted. This mod adds no new items.  Quests should consistently reward exotic items and neurotrainers, though this won't significantly alter the cash value of the rewards.  Rewards from the Imperial faction will be of higher quality.
             
                This is a manual retooling of loot tables, so will omit items from mods unless they are specifically added.  This requires little work but must be done for each item.  Feedback is appreciated.

            Adds 32 landforms to the game, which generate biome-independently. The goal of this mod is to make map generation more interesting and varied, compared to the vanilla experience of simply having either a cliff or a coast on one edge of your map.

            Blueprints allow the quick construction of repetitive rooms/areas. 
            
               &amp;amp;lt;size=24&amp;amp;gt;Features&amp;amp;lt;/size&amp;amp;gt;
                  &amp;amp;lt;b&amp;amp;gt;Create blueprint&amp;amp;lt;/b&amp;amp;gt;
                     Use the ‘Create’ designator to drag over an area with existing constructions. Floors, walls and furniture will all be designated, and included in the blueprint. once created, a popup will appear with a default name, giving you the option to set a more meaningful name. 
                        
                           &amp;amp;lt;i&amp;amp;gt;NOTE: Only constructions owned by you will be included, use the ‘Claim’ order if necessary.&amp;amp;lt;/i&amp;amp;gt;
                              
                                 &amp;amp;lt;b&amp;amp;gt;Place blueprint&amp;amp;lt;/b&amp;amp;gt;
                                    Once you’ve created a blueprint, you can use the new button to place copies of that blueprint. Blueprints can be rotated as normal. With a blueprint selected, you’ll see an outline of what will be build on the main view, and a list of items and total cost in the lower left info panel. In this panel, you can click on furniture and walls made of stuff to change what stuff should be used in their construction. 
                                       
                                          &amp;amp;lt;i&amp;amp;gt;NOTE: You can shift-click with a designator selected to use the planning mode. In this case, any walls in the blueprint will be used to create a plan for your future rooms. This might be useful for mining out the required space. &amp;amp;lt;/i&amp;amp;gt;
                                             
                                                &amp;amp;lt;b&amp;amp;gt;Rename, import &amp;amp;amp; export blueprints&amp;amp;lt;/b&amp;amp;gt;
                                                   Once you’ve created a blueprint, you can right click the blueprint button to rename, remove or export the blueprint. Exported blueprints will be saved in the same location as RimWorlds save games and config files, in a directory called “Blueprints”. If a blueprint has been exported, an option to remove and delete the exported blueprint will also appear. 
                                                      You can import previously exported blueprints by right clicking the ‘Create’ button, and selecting the blueprint from the list of available blueprints. 
                                                         
                                                            &amp;amp;lt;i&amp;amp;gt;NOTE: While you can import/export blueprints between games, be careful with doing so when a blueprint contains (modded) items that are not available in the current game. If you import a blueprint containing items that are unavailable, an error will pop up, and the offending item will be deleted from the blueprint. I’ve tried to make sure the rest of the blueprint is still usable, but your results may vary.&amp;amp;lt;/i&amp;amp;gt;

            Color code each pawn's mood bar within the colonist bar based on their current mood.\n\nRed: extreme mental break threshold\nOrange: major mental break threshold\nYellow: minor mental break threshold\nGray: neutral mood\nLight Blue: content\nGreen: happy\n\nAlso includes:\n\nBreak Box, an outline to highlight when the colonist is in a break mood, useful for "larger" colonists (default on). This can be drawn beneath or on top of the colonist to further highlight the colonist (default beneath).\nSchedule Box, an outline to show the colonists current schedule (default off).\nIllness Icon, an icon that is displayed when the colonist has an illness that requires immunity (default on).\nBleeding Icon, an icon that is displayed when the colonist is bleeding with 3 different sizes based on bleed rate, Large lt 8 hours until death, Medium lt 24 hours, Small gt 24 hours (default on).\nThermal Icons, icons for when colonists are suffereing hypotherma/heatstroke (minor and above).\nLove Relationship Icons, icons for colonists that are in relationships (heart for lovers and fiancés, rings for married couples).\n\nUpdates:\n\nPorqueNoLosDos:\n24-09-2017: Removed unnecessary error log messages.\n18-11-2017: Updated for RimWord version 0.18.1722, and added content and happy mood colors.\n04-05-2019: Updated for RimWorld version 1.0.2231.\n\nCrashM:\n24-02-2020: Updated for RimWorld version 1.1 (1.1 only, won't work on 1.0), and made it better reflect break thresholds.\n27-02-2020: Added outline box for break risks as previously extreme had such a small bar it was usually not visible.\n29-02-2020: Added Mod Settings to allow changing the color of each threshold and disable the mental break outline box if needed.\n01-03-2020: Fixed memory leak.\n04-04-2020: Added option to put the break box on top of the colonist (default off) so it is more visible for the larger colonists.\n15-06-2020: Added optional neutral break box (default off).\n28-07-2020: Added Optional Schedule Box to show colonists current schedule.\n04-09-2020: Added optional illness icon for illnesses that require immunity.\n05-09-2020: Added optional bleeding icon with 3 sizes based on bleed rate.\n15-09-2020: Performance updates and caching. I have improved performance by an average of 25% over the previous version (test has 20 colonists, same settings), I also removed the schedule box for when colonists are on the Anything schedule as this also helps performance. There is also a new Refresh Rate setting where you can decide how often the cache is refreshed (150ms seems more than enough for 20 colonists, 0 disables the cache).\n23-09-2020: More performance improvements. Please note, the performance improvement has made the cache mandatory, if this causes problems please let me know.\n27-09-2020: Bug Fix (error when enabling schedule box when in game), Added optional ability to hide portraits (helps performance).\n27-09-2020: Bug Fix.\n01-10-2020: Extended the allowed caching to 2s, and made the selection highlighting uncached.\n24-10-2020: More performance improvements (removed some reflection).\n25-10-2020: Bug Fix + Another performance improvement that make it faster than vanilla.\n25-10-2020: Bug Fix + Minor performance improvments + the bleeding icon now flashes when lt 3 hours + the illness icon will flash when severity gt immunity and severity gt 80% + the illness icon will turn yellow when immunity gt severity + the illness icon will turn green when immunity gt %5 more than severity.\n20-12-2020: Bug fix + An optional (disabled by default) alternative label that is faster but may have bugs + Thermal warning icons (colors customisable in the settings).\n27-03-2021: Added proper tooltips to the settings.\n06-04-2021: Additional Performance Improvment when enabling the Alternative Label in the settings.\n09-04-2021: Bug Fix\n23-04-2021: Added an option to force a portrait update when colonists drafted status changes (as requested by Deco)\n05-07-2021: 1.3 Compatibility\n07-07-2021: Fixed Problem with RW1.2 loading the 1.3 dll.\n23-07-2021: Ideology Update\n24-07-2021: Fixed Settings\n28-07-2021: 1.3.3074.1: Added a Version Number to help prevent issues with old versions being used.

                     - Customisability
                        - Body part replacement names (ex: peg legs, archotech eyes, Pawnmorpher morphs) get folded into the body part's name
                           - Multiple icons for various severities of bleeding and tending quality
                              - Merging hediffs by type rather than by label, treated and untreated hediffs share same entry
                                 - One icon per wound instead of vanilla's averaged single icon
                                    - Sorting hediffs for body part by severity

            This mod makes it so that people will no longer instantly die when their vital capacities reach zero. If one of your colonists has their liver destroyed by a charge lance, for instance, they will become severely ill and you will have a short window to get them a new liver before they die.
            
               The time scales in this mod are not entirely realistic, because Rimworld's time scale makes it effectively impossible for a colonist to receive life-saving care in a realistic amount of time. Colonists move too slowly, and days pass too quickly, so the numbers have been fudged to make it difficult, but possible, to save someone if you have a donor organ on hand.
                  
                     Be warned: Just because they survive, doesn't mean they won't suffer permanent brain injury as a result of their near-death experience.
                        
                           Now incorporates the functionality of Death Rattle Comatose into the main mod. Also adjusted the severity of acute liver failure and the threshold before brain damage begins to occur, which allows more time to react to the injury.
                              
                                 It should be compatible with everything. Just try it, and let me know if it doesn't work, so I can fix it.
                                    
                                       Includes a patch for EPOE: Forked so that the Neuro-Cure can be used to repair Brain Damage.

            Mod Cyber ​​Fauna - adds a lot of prostheses, improvements and operations for animals. The mod was created on the basis of B19 vanilla prosthetics, with small bonuses.
            Mod solves the health problems of animals, making those much more useful. The mod corresponds to the new mechanics of the characteristics of prostheses,
               introduced into vanilla in B19. Prosthetics for animals is being studied in parallel with prosthetics for humans. You can decide who needs prosthetics before - people or animals.
                  Many prostheses require the same resources as similar prostheses for people in B19 vanilla, but about 2 times less.
                     - Simple prostheses for animals: have 80% efficiency and require steel and components to build.
                        - Bionic prostheses for animals: have 125% efficiency and require plasteel and advanced components. Some prostheses give some small extra bonuses.
                           - Archotech prostheses for animals: have 200% efficiency and can not be created. They can only be bought from merchants, or get for quests. Some archotech-prostheses give unique bonuses.
                              - Battle Boosters (NEW) for animals: - implanted in existing parts of the body and increase the protection of the animal.
                                   
                                     In this case, the mod does not add prostheses to those parts of the body that do not affect the characteristics of the animal (nose, tail, ear, etc.).
                                        But do not worry, these parts of the body can be restored with the help of cloth and medicines! Yes, the mod adds not only prostheses,
                                           but also surgery to treat scars, to restore small parts of the body, to treat chronic diseases (Weakness, Asthma, etc.) as well as the effects
                                              accidental use of animal drugs (chemical damage, cirrhosis, etc.). But the mod does not treat ordinary diseases caused by events (influenza, malaria, etc.), as well as drug dependence.
                                                 With this mod, you will no longer feel helpless when Thrumbo joins you with weakness, or when a dog gets drunk on beer and gets chemical damage.
                                                     
                                                        Cyber ​​Fauna mod is compatible with mods on new animals. No more compatibility patches! Any animal with standard body parts can be installed.
                                                           prostheses: be it a huge dinosaur, a mutant spider or a cute little animal. No additional patches are required.
                                                              The mod works on old saves and does not require a new game. The mod is compatible with EPOE, RBSE.
                                                                 
                                                                    Cyber ​​Fauna will make your animals faster, healthier and allow them to live longer in battle. In the fashion there are no divisions by categories of animal sizes.
                                                                       This is done specifically so that compatibility patches are not required for everyone, even the smallest fashion for new animals.
                                                                          Imbalance it? Not. After all, your cat does the Yorkshire Terrier even with a full set of prostheses and boosters anyway die from a couple of bursts from the machine,
                                                                             and you will lose a lot of resources spent on prostheses. So the advice is: do not install expensive prostheses on small animals.
                                                                                
                                                                                   - Animal lab can be rearranged and built from different materials, like any machines in my mods.
                                                                                      
                                                                                         All prostheses and boosters can be found at merchants and faction bases. Arch-prosthetic devices for animals are very rare in merchants.

            You think you know what the stat "Plant Harvest Yield" does? Well, let me surprise you - it does NOT increase the amount you get when you harvest plants, like "Mining Yield" does for ores.
            
               It merely gives you a chance to fail below 100%, above 100% you do not gain anything.
                  
                     This changes now! This small C# patch changes the method when harvesting plants so that below 100% nothing changes (you still have a chance to fail, but get 100% of the amount IF you succeed) - but above 100% you get more from the plant. If you have 177% plant harvest yield and the plant usually gives 10 berries, then you now get 17 or 18 (random).
                        
                           Important: This mod removes the max values from all "yield" stats. This includes: MiningYield, AnimalGatherYield, PlantHarvestYield, ButcheryFleshEfficiency and ButcheryMechanoidEfficiency. Meaning those stats can now be more than 100%. If you don't wish this for any of these stats, go into HarvestYieldPatch/Patches/HarvestYieldXMLPatch.xml and remove the defNames of the stats you don't want edited.

            When pathfinding costs are calculated, any terrain tiles that generate filth are taken into account and given some degree of avoidance. Also, roads can be given a bonus attraction, and the overall pathfinding range can be adjusted. Other features such as light attraction and extra range can also be enabled.

               -----------------
                  &lt;color=#9b9b9b&gt;Sounds are cherry-picked (and edited even further) from games such as:
                     -  The&lt;/color&gt; &lt;b&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/b&gt; &lt;color=#9b9b9b&gt;series
                        -  The&lt;/color&gt; &lt;b&gt;Halo&lt;/b&gt; &lt;color=#9b9b9b&gt;series
                           -  The&lt;/color&gt; &lt;b&gt;Battlefield&lt;/b&gt; &lt;color=#9b9b9b&gt;series
                              &lt;size=11&gt;The sounds used are not only the highest quality possible (directly ripped from the game files, instead of trying to record the game and isolate the sounds), but some are also edited to accentuate more over-the-topness. (I am a sound designer, after all...)&lt;/size&gt;&lt;/color&gt;

            The Gene Ripper is an advanced Gene Extractor that allows you to choose the gene to be extracted from a pawn. Since a large amount of genetic material is required to extract a specific gene, the pawn is killed in the process.

I made this mod due to feeling that the graphics for the "hi-tech research bench" and "comms console" were a bit too boring and plain for my liking so I decided to make my own graphics for them. Following that I decided to continue modifying and adding research assets to fit the theme I was working toward. Full disclosure, I didn't work on this mod to the point that I would normally consider fully finished and there are a few parts I never felt fully satisfied with (the ground-penetrating scanner graphic being one example as I never could come up with a fully realized design that I liked). I am also currently playing other games and focusing on other matters in my life so I doubt I'll undertake any further updates anytime soon. To make up for that however I included a little bonus:
                                                                                                
                                                                                                   - tailor-made lab coats that slightly enhance research skills
                                                                                                      - a late game research project that unlocks plans for an advanced powered combat exoskeleton
                                                                                                         - custom graphics for both (exoskeleton artwork based upon the incomparable rooki1's work!)
                                                                                                            
                                                                                                               Quick and dirty update! Added native minification def to all items due to popular request. All usable research items (Hi-Tech Research Bench, Laboratory Station, and Research Terminal) now link with the MultiAnalyzer and each other for a benefit of +10% research speed per link. This hopefully makes up for the Laboratory Station and Research Terminal not counting as Hi-Tech Research Benches for the purpose of actively researching technologies with the bench specifically noted as a prerequisite. Enjoy!

            Allows you to recruit visitors. At a price, of course. 
            
               You can also improve your relationship with visiting factions and sell items to visiting guests. Guests will buy and use things inside of their allowed area.
                  
                     
                        Errors and bugs: If you get errors, most likely Hospitality is clashing with another mod you're using.
                           
                              So to help me fix bugs, please describe clearly what happened. I also need a log. You create it by pressing Ctrl-F12 after you get an error or the problem first occurs. You'll get a link that you can post with your description. 
                                 
                                    Hospitality should be loaded as late as possible in the load order.

            This mod allows you to control your pawn to rescue any injured pawns, even ones who are not downed.
            Sometimes, because of his bad back, your 98 years old colonist will not be able to go to bed before he bleeds out.
               When this happens, you will thank me.

            (Last update: 2019-07-07)
            
               Tired of pawns who refuse to do certain types of work, even when their own lives and the survival of the colony depend on it? This mod changes the way in which the game handles "incapabilities." On the pawns' character tabs, you'll see that the "Incapable of" list has been replaced with a list of "Hated work types." These types of work are marked in amber on the work tab, and aren't assigned by default. But they can be assigned if necessary, as any pawn can be assigned to any type of work. Be aware, though, that if you assign a pawn to do hated work, there's a mood penalty (and eventually movement and even manipulation penalties) that will only grow worse the longer the assignment lasts. This mod is intended to allow you to assign pawns to work they hate in emergency situations. It is *not* intended to allow such assignments to be made on a long-term basis.
                  
                     Note 1: Since "violent acts" aren't a specific work type, pawns who abhor violence are capable of violent acts -- combat, etc. -- if and only if they're carrying a weapon. But so long as they're armed, they will suffer mood debuffs just as if they were assigned to a work type they hate.
                        
                           Note 2: As there are easy ways to "get around" restrictions on tasks like hauling, anyway, "incapable of dumb labor" is treated a bit differently than other incapabilities. Pawns who hate dumb labor are simply given an extra trait that reduces their carrying capacity and their unskilled labor work speed. They won't be assigned to hauling or cleaning by default, but can be assigned to those tasks indefinitely with only a minor mood penalty, which doesn't get worse over time. For similar reasons, pawns who hate plant work or skilled labor can still be assigned to plant cutting with only a minor static mood penalty.
                              
                                 - Rainbeau Flambe (dburgdorf)
                                    
                                       It just works! Multiplayer ready and flexible. You can add your own limits for your modded workType with just xml. There is a whitelist for weapons in the xml config as well for you modpack makers.
                                          
                                             Note 3: Conceptually the mod works the same as its predecessor, this is a different implementation and some things are different from the original mod.
                                                
                                                   Note 4: Anger builds up, the longer a pawn is assigned or forced to do something they don't want, the more anger they get. If you stop bothering them, their anger will decay and eventally disappear. If you keep forcing them they'll reach a point where they explode and submit to your requests... if you or they survived, they'll just be lazy for a while but not so angry. Until they get fed up from you again.
                                                      
                                                         Note 5: If you force a pawn to do a job, it will incurr in a penalty, the more you force them, the more they'll anger. There are checks in place to prevent you from gaming the system so be careful of abusing your newly found powers.

If you remove it you will get red errors, you can save and reload to make them disappear.

            A collection of changes and options to make mortar accuracy better/worse, instead of having a fixed spread radius of 13 tiles.
            
               -Accuracy is affected by a colonist's Intellectual and/or Shooting skills
                  -Automatically lead moving targets
                     -Accuracy is affected by weather and time of day
                        -When targeting, preview a projectile's hit radius or show explosive radius
                           -The miss chance caused by targets being in cover is removed
                              
                                 This affects all mortar shots, including enemy mortars.
                                    
                                       Supports other mods:
                                          In general, any added mortars are supported (artillery, catapults, ballistas, etc.). Technically anything using the verb Verb_Shoot and has a force miss radius is assumed to be a mortar and is affected by this mod.
                                             
                                                Load order does not matter in order to affect modded mortars.

            ReGrowth is a mod deeply influenced by the philosophy of the Vanilla Expanded Series and the understanding how biomes work, what role they play in your game. Everything added was made to fit or mirror vanilla. From a simple UI texture to a new more complex system,being as performance and vanilla friendly is the main objective we have.
            
               Inspired by another game series I enjoy, the “Fallout” games, this mod adds three different wasteland biomes to the game. Unlike my other biomes, this one is bleak, empty, desolate and by default against the player. Wasteland biomes are always polluted, offer little food and dangerous weather.
                  
                     Wastelands are a simple biome, there is no performance hungry code or new features you will only find there. Its goal is to add variety for the player.
                        
                           ReGrowth is designed to be as lightweight as possible, adding the minimum of new code required for its auditions to work.

               This module adds 11 new extinct animals to Rimworld, brought back to life with the wonders of genetic engineering. It is quite that simple actually. All of them fit perfectly into vanilla Rimworld and will spawn in their respective biomes, but are rarer than normal vanilla animals!
                  Interesting fact, dinosaur worlds are actually in Rimworlds lore! There is a planet called "Zoutera" that is classified as a Dino-world.
                     
                        All of these lovely animals have been made as a commission by Erin, who is quite literally the queen of making Rimworld animals. Her work is amazing! Luizi gave some of them a slight touch up for the remastered version.

            Practical Pallets adds two new buildings to RimWorld, a regular ‘pallet and a ‘small pallet’. These function like shelves but, they can only store one stack/thing per tile (as opposed to three.)
            
               They can also store minified plants/furniture, and large corpses. Basically think of them as fancy ground stockpiles, except items on a pallet, do not deteriorate when outside.

               Inspired by the Disney show “The Owl House”, the Boiling Forests is a new biome filled with colourful trees, plants and hotsprings. Created by a long gone megacorp for an immersive theme park, it is unknown how this biome made its way to a Rimworld. It is by far the most unique biome I have made so far and I am honestly stunned by it myself.
                  
                     Boiling Forests are a simple biome, there is no performance hungry code you can't turn off or new features you will only find there. Its goal is to add variety for the player and to bring things from “The Owl House” into Rimworld in a lore friendly way!

            Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Architect has been on my mind for a very long time. I always download every single mod adding new floors or fences, but I quickly become buried under all the new options, and eventually get pissed off because some of those options don't exactly fit Vanilla game in my eyes.
            	
               	I want new carpet colors, but I don't want all RGB hues - I want a small, tailored selection that fits the game. I want new tiles and floors, but I don't want 100 different patterns that have no distinction between them other than the looks. I want new fences, but I don't want more fence types than there are floor types. I want less, but I want more significant!
                  	
                     	Thus, Architect Expanded was born. Not only does it add new walls, fences, floors and carpets in various, vanilla-fitting colors, it also adds stone and metal bridges, as well as foundations that you can place on sand, so building in the desert will no longer be a problem! I seem to have forgotten to mention that wood now comes in 4 colors, all using just the base wood resource - so you can decide upon building what color your wooden objects will be!
                        	
                           	I really hope you will enjoy everything this mod has to offer, and it will allow you to make your colony at least twice as beautiful to look at.

            I have always found vanilla furniture to be lacking in depth and quantity. After researching Complex Furniture, the research tree for furniture pretty much ends, with a couple of odd technologies adding things like Vitals Monitors and Hospital Beds along the way. As part of the Vanilla Furniture Expanded mod, the team consisting of the Author of Android Tiers, Atlas, and me would like to add some sort of progression to the furniture of the rim, whilst also keeping it Vanilla friendly.

            Vanilla Textures Expanded - Variations is a standalone release in the Vanilla Textures Expanded series, aiming at providing a LOT of visual variety to your vanilla bases.
            
               So, what does it do? Basically, it provides building graphics variations for the majority of vanilla‚Äôs buildings. This means every time you build a chair, the chair will have a randomized graphics. Not only that, but you can also swap the graphic of the building on command, allowing you to mix and match styles to properly decorate your base.
                  
                     The mod includes more than 150 new random building graphics for 35 vanilla buildings.

            A micro-mod which simply alters the tree draw layer so items/chunks/pawns are not drawn in front of it. This is a trade off between gameplay and graphical aesthetics, as some things may be harder to see in wooded areas. Note that this can cause especially tall modded buildings to look incorrect, like radio towers, so it may not work well for all users depending on your mod loadout.

            "Greatest hauling mod ever" - Chicken Plucker
            
               	 v1.1.1⅓
                  
                     Colonists will gather stuff in their inventory, then haul it all to a stockpile.
                        
                           This hauling mod will greatly increase hauling efficiency, because pawns can now carry more than one gun or t-shirt. Those smart and intelligent colonists can use their inventory!
                              
                                 Safe to add to existing games.
                                    Fully compatible with Combat Extended. &lt;size=20&gt;Credits and thanks:&lt;/size&gt;

            A very simple patch that sets the wealth of all constructed floors to 1. The way floors impact colony wealth in vanilla always made little sense to me, especially since all pre-placed floors on the starting map automatically counted towards your wealth. Now those raiders won't send an army after you just because you dared to lay some good-looking parquet!

            Adds more cinematic effects to ranged weapons:
            - long trails for projectiles
               - weapon animations for miniguns and bows
                  - projectiles comes from thew barrel of the gun and not from inside of the colonist.
                     - weapon movement animation for pawns missing their targets
                        - different sounds for some weapons
                           - visual effects for particle collision
                              - faster projectile speed for all projectiles
                                 
                                    You can choose which changes you want in mod settings.

            With QualityBuilder you are able to set a minimum quality you want on a Object you want to build.
            Tired of placing, deconstructing and replacing 100 of beds just to get some decent ones? This has an end now! You can set the minimum quality you want to get from you selected objects.
               
                  If the finished object does not met your minimum quality requirements, it will get deconstructed and replaced in same position and same stuff

            Trade Helper is a small tool which expands the Trading Dialog and helps you trade in RimWorld. This includes:
            - A Wish list: a configurable list of desired items, when a trader holds any matched items, these items will be clearly highlighted so you won't miss what you seek (especially handy when you are targeting certain goods).
               - Items to be bought: clearly displays the items you are buying.
                  - Items to be sold: clearly displays the items you are selling (minimise the risk selling the wrong item).
                     - Slightly enhanced the Trading Dialog (mouse hover highlights etc).
                        - Enhanced the Caravan Dialog so it has similar features to the Trading dialog (updated 2020/06/02).
                           
                              Compatability:
                                 - Should work with most MODs as this only tweaks the Trading/Caravan UI;
                                    - Work with existing saves;
                                       - Requires Harmony.
                                          - This Mod assumes your screen resolution is wider than 1300px as it adds 300px side space to the Trading/Caravan Dialogs.
                                             
                                                Updates:
                                                   - 2020/06/03: fixed a small display issue.
                                                      - 2020/06/06: fixed a mod conflict.
                                                         - 2020/08/15: now supports v1.2 (not tested with Royalty though).
                                                            - 2020/08/16: fixed a conflict with mod RimThemes.
                                                               - 2021/07/31: now supports v1.3 (not tested with DLC as I don't have).
                                                                  - 2022/10/22: now supports v1.4 (not tested with DLC as I don't have).
                                                                     
                                                                        Trade Helper是一个稍稍优化交易窗口的小工具。它的功能包括：
                                                                           - 愿望单：可配置的愿望清单，当商人持有你愿望单中的物品时，该物品整行会高亮显示。
                                                                              - 购入物品栏：清晰地显示你准备买入的物品。
                                                                                 - 卖出物品栏：清晰地显示你准备卖出的物品（再也不会忘掉把人皮沙发卖掉啦！）。
                                                                                    - 稍微优化了交易窗口，例如增加了鼠标悬停高亮等。
                                                                                       - 优化了远行窗口，现在远行窗口拥有和交易窗口类似的功能（2020/06/02更新）。
                                                                                          
                                                                                             兼容性：
                                                                                                - 由于只是稍调整了交易和远行窗口的显示方式，所以应该可以兼容绝大部分Mod。
                                                                                                   - 旧档可兼容，不需要开新档。
                                                                                                      - 需要Harmony。
                                                                                                         - 由于在交易和远行窗口增加了侧边栏，所以本Mod需要玩家屏幕的分辨率至少达到1300像素宽。
                                                                                                            
                                                                                                               更新：

                                                                                                                           - 2020/08/16: 修正了与RimThemes的Mod冲突问题。

            Replace the stuff that a thing is made from, e.g. replace a wall's materials.
            	
               This mod does NOT deconstruct and reconstruct. It preserves the existing building and replaces materials in-place.
                  
                     Also, blueprints are allowed over rock and fog.
                        	
                           A new button in the Architect/Structure menu to replace any building's materials.
                              Regular buildings that are ordered to be built on top of a copy are replaced instead of reconstructed.
                                 		
                                    It doesn't break down the existing building, which means:
                                       Replacing walls doesn't break the room, and keeps freezers cold.
                                          Replacing workbenches doesn't delete bills.
                                             
                                                Check Steam page for any updated info.

            Mod Version: 1.11.3\n\nRimHUD is a UI mod that displays detailed information about a selected character or creature. The HUD display is integrated into the inspect pane which can be resized to fit the additional information. Alternatively, the HUD can display a separate floating window and can be docked to any position on the screen.\n\nVisual warnings will appear if a pawn has any life-threatening conditions, has wounds that need tending to, or is close to a mental breakdown.

            RimWorld mod adding `Stack Refill Threshold` and `Similar Stack Limit` to stockpiles and deep storage inspired by kanban logistic control systems.
            
               ## Features
                  #### Stack Refill Threshold
                     * Just like "pause when satisfied" for a bill—but for hauling to stockpile stacks!
                        * Defaults to 100% which gives the same as behavior as vanilla.
                           
                              *Example*: Set your RimFridge Important dining room stockpile to 20% and it won't trigger hauling jobs for any specific stack until there are less than or equal to 2 meals left in it (meal stack size is 10).
                                 
                                    #### Similar Stack Limit
                                       * No more than `Similar Stack Limit` stacks of a thing are allowed in the stockpile.
                                          * Defaults to `OFF` which gives the same behavior as vanilla.
                                             
                                                #### Maximum Stack Size
                                                   * Limit Stack Size for smaller custom sized stacks per stockpile
                                                      * Defaults to `OFF` which gives the same behavior as vanilla.
                                                         
                                                            *Example*: Set your Medicine Cabinent Preferred hospital stockpile to a `Similar Stack Limit` of 1 and you will get no more than a single stack of any medicine and drug type now instead of clogging it up nothing but rotting herbal medicine and smoke leaf joints!
                                                               
                                                                  #### First Class Multiplayer Support
                                                                     * Data stored using determenistic dictionary keys and all state mutations properly sync'd!
                                                                        * All development done in a multiplayer context locally with arbiter to minimize potential desyncs.
                                                                           
                                                                              ## Full Example
                                                                                 Setup a raw ingredients food Preferred stockpile in the kitchen next to your stove. Set the `Stack Refill Threshold` to 0% and the `Similar Stack Limit` to 1. This way you will get a variety of fresh ingredients close to the cook and will reduce spoilage because the stack is not refilled until it has been completely used up.
                                                                                    
                                                                                       ## Performance
                                                                                          * Uses `for` loops similar to vanilla style code for basic `C#` optimization
                                                                                             * Skips hot code paths anytime a stockpile is set to default values
                                                                                                * Avoid using high values of `Similar Stack Limit` in large stockpiles as it must scan every thing in every cell
                                                                                                   * Turn off `Reserved Similar Stockpile Limiting` in Settings if you have an older CPU or large colony with many reserved hauling jobs to scan
                                                                                                      
                                                                                                         ## Compatible Mods

            Your colonists can never be a true Rambo if they cannot gun while they are running. Therefore, this mod adds a mode that, when enabled, allows drafted colonists to shoot 
            while moving at the cost of an accuracy and movement penalty.These penalties can be modified in the mod settings of this mod. 
               Some things to take into account: 
                  - Fire at will should be enabled. Firing manually will cause the pawn to stop running. 
                     - RunAndGun mode can only be enabled when the pawn is drafted, and is carrying a ranged weapon in its hands. 
                        - The movement penalty is only applied at the moment the pawn is actually shooting or cooling down after shooting. So don't bother disabling RunAndGun every time you just want your pawn to walk somewhere. 
                           
                              &lt;color=orange&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dependencies &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;
                                 
                                    This mod depends on Hugslib, so make sure that mod loads before this mod does.
                                       
                                          &lt;color=orange&gt;&lt;b&gt;Compatibility &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;
                                             
                                                This mod should be compatible with existing saves, and removing the mod from saves shouldn't introduce problems. Moreover, this mod should be compatible with most other mods (including Combat Extended). However, keep in mind that this is hard to test for me by myself, and this is the first release.
                                                   Therefore some issues regarding mod compatibility are bound to come up. Most issues that come up should be easy to fix, so please report any problems.

            This started out as a fork and merging of the Better Vents and Better Coolers mod, utilizing the Vanilla Expanded Framework instead, along with more compatible definition patching methods. It has evolved to include new features such as a wall heater, wall lights, and fencepost lamps.

            Doctors will use medicine from their inventory. What a concept!
            		
               Doctors can also use medicine from the patient's inventory, or anyone else on the map, even pack animals brought on a caravan.
                  
                     They can also keep their inventory stocked with medicine. The Gear Tab has Settings for each Colonist.
                        
                           An option to use cheaper medicine, if it will do just as well ( due to doctor skill, bionics, medical bed, etc. ) Note this doesn't affect surgery.
                              
                                 An option to use minimal medicine for non-urgent wounds, or none at all.
                                    
                                       An option to tend patients in the field - if there are no beds available, or just always.
                                          
                                             Multiple doctors can reserve the same stack of medicine. The game actually supports multiple reservations, but the feature was just not used.
                                                
                                                   Now technically, inventory medicine is dropped and immediately picked back up - but what can you do.
                                                      
                                                         Check Steam page for any updated info.

            &lt;size=16&gt;&lt;color=lightblue&gt;Overview&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/size&gt;
            
               Turrets can be covered by adjacent objects, but 2x2 or larger turrets can only take cover on the bottom-left-most tile.
                  In other words, when attacked from the upper right, turrets are considered uncovered and don't receive any cover effect.
                     
                        This mod allows 2x2 or larger turrets to be covered by adjacent object in all directions.

                                          砲塔は､隣接するバリケードなどで掩蔽できますが､2x2以上の大きさを持つ砲塔は､左下のタイルしか掩蔽されません｡
                                             言い換えれば､右上から攻撃された場合は（仮に障害物があっても）掩蔽されていないと見なされ､掩蔽率は0になります｡
                                                
                                                   このMODは､2x2以上の砲塔も隣接する障害物で全方位から掩蔽できるようにします｡

It's an all-in-one, containing all the modules in a single mod, internally modularized within the mod options. Giddy-Up allows pawns to ride animals around on the map, or even use them as battle mounts.

               This mod allows for a fine-tune configuration of the tickrate in a Multiplayer game.
                  
                     This can be especially useful in situations where performance is an issue - instead of being permanently tied to a lower speed now you'll be able to lower the tickrate just enough to have enjoyable performance.
                        
                           Only works in Multiplayer games - has no effect whatsoever when playing single-player.

            Vanilla Animals Expanded is a large mod that contains almost all previous Vanilla Animals Expanded modules, this time merged into one big mod. Fear not, however - last thing we want is to bloat your game: you can now disable individual animals in mod options! You can only enable the animals that appear in your biome if you want.
            
               The reason we merged all the animal mods is because they are finished - the only new animals we have planned fit into standalone packs. We have already covered all the biomes, so it’s only proper we clean it up and make it into one big mod.
                  
                     No, we have no plans to merge any other mods together.
                        
                           This mod adds dozens of new animals that fit RimWorld aesthethic, from house cats and rottweilers to anacondas and indian elephants, it really breathes a lot of life into the game and makes every biome feel very, very unique.

            Caves is one of the biomes we have never covered or even considered covering before, but here we are! With this mod, you can tame powerful cave bears, collect colorful blind salamanders, run away from insectoid hulks, bond with incredibly agile and dangerous wyrms, get poisoned by cave crawlers or discover giant spider nests!
            
               This mod supports the Arachnophobia setting which removes legs from the spiders, making them look much more friendly!
                  
                     This mod has been commissioned by Aquiles and created and balanced by Vanilla Expanded team.
                        
                           Vanilla Animals Expanded is a modular mod. It means it will come out in several modules allowing people to subscribe to only the animals they want in the game. This part is the Endangered biome expansion. It adds 11 new animals that will spawn as part of a new event. They have vanilla artwork, sounds and balancing.

            Remember how I said the Temperate animals mod was the last one? Well, people lie. There is still a few animals around the world that we did not yet make into actual RimWorld animals - and this time we have decided to also raise awareness of the big issue in our world - endangered species and animal conservation.
            
               From pandas and pangolins to already extinct tasmanian tigers and quaggas, you can now help with animal conservation in RimWorld. These animals, just like in our world, are endangered, and don’t appear naturally on the map. Instead, they can arrive in a rare ‘Endangered animals wander in’ event, giving you a chance to tame them and breed them. Releasing them to repopulate their species - which is a new option added by this mod - allows you to gain relations with other factions too!

            Royal animals is something we have promised a long time ago, and never quite found the time to deliver. From the very initial notions, what we wanted to do is to introduce some special animals with unique gimmicks that could go alongside the pampered nobles in the Royalty DLC.
            
               This is a great opportunity for us to create something super unique and not entirely realistic - whilst also making the Royalty DLC more attractive by utilising mechanics and code added in it. I hope this selection of animals will make you want to collect them all, as each of them comes with a unique function that’s bound to come in handy.

            Vanilla Armour Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Weapons Expanded and Vanilla Apparel Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days.
            
               Armor is spread across several new technologies that need to be researched which in turn adds valuable game time before you achieve everything there is to achieve. New items cover all technological eras, from wooden armours of neolithic tribes, through chainmails and chestplates of medieval kingdoms, bulletproof vests and ghillie suits of the modern era combat all the way to two, brand new variants of a regular marine armor - one of them with an integrated ranged shield belt!

            Vanilla Backstories Expanded was a mod suggested by my patrons right after we released Vanilla Backgrounds Expanded and everyone thought that was the mod adding backstories. It wasn’t. This one is.
            
               This mod features over 150 backstories, carefully selected from the submissions from our Patrons and testers, as well as quite a large number of backstories written by us, VE team members. I have ran a little experiment and asked various people from our community channels to write their own backstory that reflects what they do in real life, but placed in RimWorld universe. Some submissions have been absolutely stellar, and that inspired us to put them in the game.
                  
                     We have paid extreme attention to making sure that they all fit the game perfectly. They should be very well balanced as well - we made several balance passes and ran a VE-team vote on the most fitting backstories.
                        
                           If you find any typos or issues, please be sure to let us know, telling us which specific backstory you have found a problem with!

            Vanilla Base Generation Expanded is a mod many have been waiting for. Probably one of the most disappoint aspects of venturing out in a caravan in RimWorld is the fact that no matter where you go and no matter what base you raid, after you’ve seen one, you’ve seen them all. Vanilla Bases tend to often resemble so called ‘20 granite door borg cube bases’.
            
               Kikohi set out on a mission to fix that, and with the help from our testing community, we have created a huge library of assets that the base will pull out of, procedurally generating unique villages, towns and megabases every time you visit a new location.
                  
                     The look of the bases and the assets use vary from faction to faction - tribal villages will have swathes of farmland around them, whilst pirate bases will be essentially bunkers with mortars and automatic defenses.

            Vanilla Brewing Expanded is an alcohol-oriented module in “Vanilla Cuisine Expanded” from the Vanilla Expanded team, notably Sarg Bjornson, Oskar Potocki and Chowder. Whilst other mods such as Vanilla Plants Expanded and Vanilla Fishing Expanded work well as standalone, due to technical limitations Vanilla Brewing Expanded requires the Core cooking mod.
            
               We made sure to keep the mechanics of this mod simple and intuitive without ruining the spirit of vanilla gameplay. All elements of this mod offer unique advantages and disadvantages, enhancing the depth of the game a thousandfold. With 7 unique, new alcohol types, you can now tailor your colonists’ drinking habits to your liking, with each alcohol having a unique production chain, buffs, downsides and uses.
                  
                     We strive to add unique elements for every single one of our players. A widely requested feature - tea and coffee, has also been added, allowing you to brew an immunity boosting hot tea, or whip out hot and iced coffees that help with staying awake and provide help against hypothermia and heat stroke respectively. Cigarettes and cigars also make an appearance, very addictive but incredibly helpful in stressful situations.

               Vanilla Brewing Expanded - Coffee and Tea is another sub-module to the new Vanilla Cuisine Expanded mod series.

                           With Vanilla Plants Expanded you will gain access to Lemons, and Vanilla Cooking Expanded will allow you to farm mint - a new condiment boosting social impact!

            Vanilla Cooking Expanded - Stews is a first sub-module to the new Vanilla Cuisine Expanded mod series. This particular mod introduces medieval stews - which are more nutritious, more expensive soups that are cooked over time on the wood-fired pot.
            
               Ideal for your medieval colonies and long winter nights, these stews remove any debuffs from eating ingredients like insect meat and human meat! Time to sneak some human flesh into your diet.

            Vanilla Cooking Expanded - Sushi is the second sub-module to the new Vanilla Cuisine Expanded mod series. This particular mod introduces sushi - a fish and rice based food that is immensely popular on the Rim.
            
               The module is an amazing way to make good use of our fishing mod, since all sushi meals need fish. It also includes two new plants, wasabi and soybeans, and two new condiments extracted from them: wasabi paste and soy sauce. Soy sauce needs to be fermented, and its quality will increase with time, in case you decide to use it as a "cash crop".
                  
                     And of course you can always deep fry your sushi.

            Vanilla Events Expanded adds several new events to the game, all in line with vanilla events - nothing too drastic. A new tier of events is added - Purple events. Instead of having strict negative or positive effects, purple events force players to adapt as they last significantly longer than events like Toxic Fallout or Volcanic Winter.

            After a long delay, our brand new Vanilla Factions Expanded module is now ready. Insectoids feature a diversified, new, unplayable faction that will populate the world with insects and monstrosities your colonists never dreamt of. Led by an Ancient Insectoid queen, these eusocial creatures can be heard chittering underground, with outposts and villages across the surface mysteriously disappearing overnight.
            
               Vanilla Factions Expanded - Insectoids allows you to take a fight to the insects. No longer such an interesting faction will be limited to one ingame event only. Insectoids now possess bases on the surface - in the form of overrun outposts filled with riches and hives for you to purge.
                  
                     They will now be allowed to raid, the same way as mechanoids or other factions can. They won’t engage in diplomacy and they won’t give you quests - as they are forever hostile. This mod features a number of new insectoids filling various niches whilst still keeping the feel of the faction the same as in vanilla - melee only, relying on swarming their opponents.
                        
                           For those brave enough to harness their power, bio-engineering is now a thing. Obtained from traders and quest rewards only, players can now vat-grow over 20 unique insectoids, obeying their every command and performing tasks around the base.
                              
                                 Genomes used in bio-engineering can also be implanted in colonists and prisoners alike, leading to various genetic mutations - some good, some bad.
                                    
                                       New riot gear is craftable and ready to be used by your base security whilst new quest-reward only plasma weapons will allow you to get rid of the insectoids even more effectively.
                                          
                                             Mercenaries starting scenario pits you in the battle against the insectoids at the very beginning, placing you on the outskirts of an overrun outpost. Can you clear it out with your superior weaponry and call it home? Or will you evacuate the area and find a new settlement?

            Unite the broken Republics against the common enemy. Stop the senators from squabbling and plotting against each other by completing a chain of missions to gain their favor. 
            Each senator on your side will provide you with more political power in the senate, as well as new technologies, regular tributes and a helping hand when you need it the most. 
               What the brochure doesn’t mention is the fact that each senator on your side is a senator living under your protection, a pawn you need to care for and defend, as they are not always a skilled fighter.
                  Gaining support of enough senators can give you access to new weapons, such as Javelins and Spathas, new structures such as thermae bath or crafting bench, or new technologies such as road building!
                     
                        Vanilla Factions Expanded - Classical is a unique faction mod, creating a bridge between neolithic and medieval technological eras. The whole purpose of the mod is to introduce a faction called the Republic, divided into 3 subfactions. 
                           Player can side with each of them, as each of them provides different rewards - both in unlockable technologies and in actual paid tribute.

            One of the first mods I ever came up with, and one that took the longest to design, draw, code and deliver, Vanilla Factions Expanded - Mechanoids is a mod unlike any other. A group of talented modders came together to make sure this mod is not only full of new interesting content, but also provides something to make the game a bit more dynamic.
            
               We have improved on the Custom Settlement Generation code to provide you with semi-random spaceships that Mechanoids can use to wreak havoc on the planet’s surface. Thanks to a lot of cooperation from some of the most famous modders out there, we were able to provide you with not just a new faction, but a unique mechanic of Total War, which makes the faction stronger the more ships land on the planet. We were also able to give you a little Factorio love letter in the form of fully automated machines that produce various items in the game, automatically. Did I mention it’s all happening automatically?
                  
                     New buildable mechanoids can fill various roles around your colony, from cleaning and hauling to base defense. With supercomputers, you can now automate research, Autosowers and Autoharvesters on the other hand will allow you to begin your farming enterprise with no need for physical labor.
                        
                           New quests, new events, new starting scenario, a storyteller, it’s all waiting for you. Merry Christmas!

            After 6 months in development and almost 2 months in beta testing, we are absolutely ecstatic to show you the effect of our hard work - Vanilla Factions Expanded - Vikings. This mod will enhance your selection of pre-industrial factions by adding two new Viking tribes - both with new, custom-made, legit name generators! It’s up to you to decide whether you want to help them pillage, or get pillaged by them!
            
               This mod utilises a vast amount of new custom code we made available in Vanilla Expanded framework, including custom base generation code, which makes all sieges much more authentic! A number of new weapons, armor, apparel and furniture is also added, greatly adding to your selection of medieval flavour. To those who prefer spacer vibes, rare, experimental cryptotech weapons and armor are also added - now you can literally freeze your enemies as you shoot them!
                  
                     Various new quests and events allow you to add more dynamic to any playthrough, as they will work just as well for a viking clan as they will for industrial or spacer colony. Hunt legendary creatures, explore ancient dangers, ransack viking tombs or get raided by two new raid types - pillagers, who will come and go like a thunder, stealing your valuables and throwing torches at your base, and slavers, led by a number of wolfhounds, they will try to kidnap all your colonists!
                        
                           Freya Fierce storyteller introduces a new raid restlessness mechanic, forcing your colony to venture into the world and complete missions in order to remove a stacking debuff for inactivity! Event-wise, she’s just like Randy, but allows you to have 2x as many pawns due to the need for annual caravans.
                              
                                 This mod is the effect of hard work of a large number of us. I really hope you will appreciate it. Check out our new Youtube channel for a full content breakdown.

            Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Art module is something long overdue. Being an artist, I struggled to comprehend why the only type of sculptures we can make are small, large or grand artworks on a tiny pedestal. It made Artistic skill pretty much undesirable. Come on, how many times have you said to yourself “Oh crikey, that’s another pawn that can only do art”? 
            
               A lot of people requested this mod on my Patreon so it’s about time I deliver. With this mod, your colony can create simple pottery from neolithic times, allowing you to gain some silver on the side to kickstart your base into the medieval era. Several new pieces of sculptures are available by the likes of small, large and grand statues, wall reliefs, decorative pillars and plinths that act both as an artwork and a shelf.
                  
                     With industrial era your colony will be able to produce beautiful embroidered rugs to decorate those ugly floors! A new type of wall - wallpaper - is now also available, allowing you to put some colour onto your grim, broken walls. Spacer era features a new type of art called a hologram, emitting beautiful shade of blue light and using intellectual skill to determine the quality of it - however it does use up power!
                        
                           And if that isn’t enough, a new type of quest reward is available - Archotech sculptures, not only being extremely beautiful and desirable, but also imprinting stunning imagery in the minds of surrounding colonists!

            Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Farming module is a great way to boost the efficiency of your colonies when it comes to providing food on the table. With a plethora of new hydroponics - one for early game and one for late game, you can really witness the technological progression of your colony - and gain more enjoyment from the game itself.
            
               A very popular request on all suggestion threads on RimWorld Ludeon forums is draggable hydroponics - at this point I believe it’s my duty to deliver, hence all three kinds of hydroponics now have a draggable version! Make it any shape you want!
                  
                     New structures by the likes of animal feeder, a sprinkler and a scarecrow have been added, each with unique code to make them feel more authentic. The scarecrow will actually make animals flee, hence stopping them from devouring all your precious potatoes!

            Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Production module, is an ideal mod to fill that late game hole in production. Once you set up your vanilla workstations with tool cabinets scattered everywhere, you essentially got as far as you possibly can. This carefully designed, vanilla-fitting mod adds a new layer to workstation layout, hopefully allowing players to create manufacturing-designated rooms instead of one massive room with all the workbenches.
            
               Linkables:
                  - Kitchen Sink Cabinet
                     - Tailor Cabinet
                        - Smithy Cabinet
                           - Machining Cabinet
                              - Drug Cabinet
                                 - Fabrication Cabinet
                                    
                                       Workbenches:
                                          - Component Bench 
                                             - Fueled Smelter
                                                - Electric Butcher
                                                   - Electric Drug Lab

            Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Props and Decor is a major mod release that has been in production for almost 8 months. The main aim is to provide much needed customizability to your bases and cities, a way to add some detail to your rooms and buildings, and to generally allow you to place more of “you” inside the game.
            
               This mod adds almost 350 hand drawn, vanilla-like props, spread across several categories, from place-able filth to space ships. All these props have no functionality in the game - a sink prop doesn’t use Dubs Bad Hygiene, a shelf prop isn’t an actual shelf, and it doesn’t need Deep Storage to work. All these props are simply decorations, and to reward players for placing them, they each provide 1 Beauty - which means they slightly level the beauty rating of the room they are in.
                  
                     Why didn’t we add functionality to these props? Because of the sheer amount of them - I wouldn’t forgive myself if I didn’t add function to ALL of them. I wouldn’t be satisfied with just 30 props with functions while the rest would just be props. I have then decided all of those should be simply props, as the name of the mod suggests.
                        
                           Well don’t wait any longer, download this mod, use the new props to decorate your base and make sure to tell your friends about it too! Everyone wants to place a puddle of vomit in their hospitals!

            The first iteration of this mod, Medieval faction, is a missing link between tribals and outlanders. With this mod you can experience the proper medieval siege, as the enemy base generation builds a massive, towering fortress with buildings inside. Have your own vineyard and brew the best wine, which gains in value the longer it’s in the barrel! Medieval subjects will be equipped with new armor, color-coded depending on the faction color, making medieval armies look like an actual army serving the same lord. Receive caravans of medieval armor makers, weaponsmiths, mercenaries and the elusive art patron!

            Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Security module is a result of hours upon hours of hard work. It has been a long time since we began working on this mod, and with a team of brilliant programmers, I am not honored to present to you a Vanilla Expanded approach to base defenses. Every word and every stat in this mod have been carefully prepared to be as balanced and as “vanilla” as possible. 
            
               This module introduces 27 new defense structures, all neatly filling up the Security tab in the Architect menu. With research technologies spread out across all stages of the game, this mod itself is enough to provide you with hours of entertainment.

            Vanilla power generation is somewhat lackluster late game - Not only the game strongly encourages the use of solar panels and wind turbines as they provide significantly more energy at the cost of no fuel, but it also stops there - there is no technological progression in regards to power. Whether you’re an early industrial colony, or a spacer super-empire (and we all like to roleplay different ways), you’re bound to use the same power sources.
            
               Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Power module adds a plethora of new power sources, ranging all the way from small portable generators and large scale industrial ones, all the way to advanced spacer-tech green energy sources and a unique, and yet easy to understand nuclear generator. A selection of new batteries will help you with storing the power, whist the new utilities like a lightning rod and chemfuel pump will give you brand new ways of obtaining power and fuel.
                  
                     A new, vanilla-fitting energy chain has been added in the form of helixien gas - a combustible substance found mostly on the planets on the galaxy rim. It can be used to power a vast array of new gas-operated structures, making them completely immune from solar flares! Helixien gas can be stored in gas tanks for later use, uses a gas pipe system for connecting to structures and can easily be turned into electricity using gas-operated generators!

            Vanilla Chemfuel Expanded is a small mod created to showcase what the new Pipe network code is capable of in Vanilla Expanded framework. It adds a simple chain to extract Deepchem from the underground pockets and refine it into Chemfuel. It also adds storage solutions for both Deepchem and standard chemfuel, alongside a few structures including a Refinery and Chemfuel tap. Player can now connect any refuelable chemfuel-powered structures to the pipe network to make sure everything refuels automatically.
            	
               This mod is not trying to be better than other available chemfuel-related mods. Instead, it exists to showcase what our framework is capable of doing, and to provide an example for other modders what they can do if they choose to use Vanilla Expanded Framework. As a by-product, it's a vanilla-friendly mod that adds an infinite source of chemfuel provided that the player constructs the required infrastructure.

            Vanilla Genetics Expanded is an overhaul to a popular mod by Sarg Bjornson called Genetic Rim. The mechanics of the predecessor have been improved greatly to fit Vanilla Expanded playstyle, offering many new paths to explore in a mid to late game colony. You can now incubate unique hybrids using brand new genetic engineering system, utilising powerful boosters and genoframes to create animals stronger, smarter and quicker than anything you've ever seen. Stay vigilant though, as there is always a chance of an experiment failing, producing one of many new failure outcomes - such as cute and cuddly fleshlings, or powerful, ever-expanding fleshgrowth.
            	
               	Venture out into the unknown with a new abandoned lab quest, procure equipment needed to continue experiments, breed paragon creatures - a real pinacle of bio-engineering, and in the end give life to an Archocentipede through a brand new path to end the game.
                  	
                     	Vanilla Genetics Expanded introduces a Hybrid quality system, encouraging the player to create higher-quality hybrids which get improved stats across the board. Alternatively, focus on overwhelming the enemy with hordes of lower quality beasts. At the end of the day, it's all up to you.
                        	
                           	With Ideology DLC, two new memes will allow you to explore different avenues of the bio-engineering path. Will you be a wicked scientist? Or will you follow things by the book?

            We have all been there, with a colony of a hundred pawns where everyone looks somewhat the same. Starting colonists with no character to their looks. This mod is our attempt at fixing that.
            
               We have worked hard to create a hundred new hairstyles that fit vanilla RimWorld perfectly! From tribals to space refugees, every possible pawn receives a set of new, fitting styles that add much needed character and soul to them, and with so many new possibilities, it’s unlikely two of your pawns will look the same!
                  
                     And in case they do, one of our major features is a barber’s table - a workbench available to be built from the very start of the game, that allows you to change the hairstyle, colour and beard style of your pawns. Yes, you heard me right. We’re also adding 15 beards, which have a solid 20% chance to spawn on any male colonist! If, however, beards are not something you’re into, you can disable them in the mod settings!

            Vanilla Helixien Gas Expanded is a brand new mod for the release of RimWorld 1.4. With this update, we've decided that it's best we split Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Power and the Helixien gas, as not only it gives us more control over it, but it's also the only logical choice, as the helixien gas is very complex and occupies a big portion of VFE-Power.
              
                 When you update your Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Power to 1.4, you will no longer have Helixien gas in it. If you'd still like it: you need to download this mod as well. Previous Helixien gas system was coded by Fluffy, but because he is no longer around as often, we decided to move the system to the one written by Kikohi which we already used in Vanilla Chemfuel Expanded.
                    
                       With this mod you will be able to drill for Helixien gas and install a pump that gives you access to cheap, combustible and nearly infinite fuel supply. You can construct numerous appliances that rely on gas and are solar flare immune. From gas stoves and smithys to lamps and heaters, you can now bring the gas power to your colony.

            Vanilla Ideology Expanded - Dryads is a mod expanding on the selection of gauranlen dryads in the Ideology DLC. Whilst the idea behind them fulfilling the majority of the roles in your colony is neat, the current selection of dryads feels lackluster - they don’t particularly have any powerful abilities worth mentioning.
            This mod changes that - from new dryad types that fill roles not explored before, to upgrades to existing dryads, the whole gauranlen dryad system can finally become a focus point of the colony.
               
                  Integration with the Vanilla Ideology Expanded - Anima Theme also means that these new dryads get a reskin that suits Anima style if you have this mod active.
                     This mod is meant to enhance Mr Samuel’s new Youtube series with some more dryad variety.

            Vanilla Ideology Expanded is a mini-series of mods aimed at expanding the content in ideology - be it memes, relics and symbols or icons alike.
            
               This mod introduces many new headgear types and one new outfit type for your ideological pawns. No longer you will be limited by the selected few new headwraps and burkas for your Role generation - your leaders will now be able to wear amazing new headgear such as Horse mask or fez, while moralists will adorn themselves in rags, similar to those of typical monks.
                  
                     On top of that, Vanilla Apparel Expanded apparel is also patched with this mod, allowing it to be desired by ideologies or specific roles! Of course it doesn’t mean it’s random or anything, on the contrary, you can now expect that your shooting specialists might require military apparel, while medical specialists will want to wear medical scrubs.

            This mod adds another 40 'useless' relic items like Chalice, Ark or Shard in Ideology DLC. You can now find Shards of a Sword, mechanoid head, Mysterious orb and many, many more. Furthermore, this mod unlocks all the apparel in the game from being unable to spawn as relics, which means your colonists might now find holy power armor helmets or sacred boots. This should greatly enhance ideologies generated by the game.

            The goal of this mod is to add a new mechanic to make ideologies a bit more of a gameplay affecting challenge, as well as introduce a new form of threat that needs to be countered by the player once the colony is big enough.
            
               Ideologies, while docile and strong in small societies, often tend to divide larger societies. The more people there is, the more ideologies differ. This mod introduces an Ideological Schism, which is an event in which a new ideology emerges in some percent of your colonists. In a way, the new ideology is very much similar to what the base ideology is, except for one or two different memes.
                  
                     This will result in a player having two unique ideologies in one colony, both struggling to become dominant. Once one of the two ideologies completely vanishes, a new schism can occur.

            Vanilla Nutrient Paste Expanded is a small mod created to showcase what the new Pipe network code is capable of in Vanilla Expanded framework. It adds a rather simple chain, unlocked with Nutrient Paste research project, allowing the player to store nutrient paste in advance without the need for convoluted nutrient paste dispensers and hoppers. Players will now pipe nutrient paste directly from paste grinders into large storage vats. This can be connected to special output valves which serve prisoners and colonists with a not-so-tasty disgusting-looking stew.
            
               The introduction of nutrient paste dripper will allow you to automatically feed bed-bound colonists or prisoners. Truly the stuff of nightmares.
                  
                     Nutrient paste pipes can now be connected to any structure requiring nutrients, such as the Growth Vat, and will automatically supply it with required fuel.
                        
                           We are not removing the current nutrient paste dispenser or changing how it works - well, maybe a little change, but other than that this mod serves as new content, not changes to existing content.

            Vanilla Outposts Expanded will allow you to form a caravan, travel in the world map and create a camp. There are various types of camps, and each of them requires specific conditions to be met before they are set up. Each of these camps ships resources to the player. You are able to build a new Outpost Drop off spot to designate where the resources should appear.
            	
               	This allows you, the player, to set up resource chains and get rid of useless colonists at the same time. Be careful though, as outposts can be attacked and you will be forced to defend them!

            Vanilla Persona Weapons Expanded is a mod that makes persona weapons a little bit more spicy - but only visually so. It never felt right that such a unique weapon does not actually look that unique - you can meet dozens of imperial royals, and all their persona weapons will just look like copies of themselves. I mean, youâ€™d probably customize your own weapon to be a bit more unique if you had it, am I right? 
            	
               With this mod, players not only are guaranteed a persona weapon of their choice and design upon reaching a rank of a Baron/Baroness, but every persona weapon in the game will now have a unique look. There is over 50 thousand different combinations, so I really doubt you will see the same looking persona weapon twice.
                  
                     This mod requires Royalty DLC.

            Vanilla Plants Expanded is a core module in a plant-based in the new mod series “Vanilla Cuisine Expanded” from the Vanilla Expanded team. After hours of designing, testing and  designing again, Sarg Bjornson, Oskar Potocki and Chowder are proud to present this content pack to help you with your RimWorld farming simulator. This mod features a variety of fruit plants and crops to spice up your fields, with each prop adding something different and unique, allowing you to use the power of farming differently based on your situation and needs.
            
               Adding a variety of crops, each with different mechanics and traits, but still kept within vanilla balancing, we are hoping to give you a chance to tailor your farming industry to your liking. These plants are not meant to replace vanilla plants - they are balanced in-line with those, meaning rice and potatoes will still be useful!
                  
                     Fruit trees are biome-locked to two unique new fruit trees per biome, however bear in mind they do not differ nutrition-wise from one another - which is partly the reason why we decided to biome lock them. We also didn’t want to flood your farming menus with 12 different fruit trees that yield pretty much the same, but reskinned, item. This has all been done with the ease of use in mind.
                        
                           A new ability to plow soil has also been introduced once you meet the designated research. Plowing soil boosts its fertility to that of Rich soil, however when the plant is harvested, tilled soil returns to its previous form and needs to be plowed again.
                              
                                 This mod has built in patches for Vanilla Cooking Expanded, adding new functionality, such as new condiment recipes!

            Vanilla Plants Expanded - More Plants is an add-on module for Vanilla Plants Expanded from the Vanilla Expanded team. This mod adds a variety of fruit plants and crops to spice up your fields even further, with each prop adding something different and unique, allowing you to use the power of farming differently based on your situation and needs.
            
               Two new unique types of growing zone have been added: sandy and aquatic growing zones. These add new crops each, that can only be grown on them. They ignore fertility, but their crops will take a long time to sow and harvest, basically exchanging colonist work for growing plants in a normally unused space.
                  
                     Finally, by researching vegetable milk production, you can turn rice, coconuts, almonds, oats (with VE Cooking) and Soybeans (with VE Sushi) into milk. This is inefficient, and useful if a recipe NEEDS base game milk. It is not a way to work around Fine meals needing meat or animal products.

            Vanilla Plants Expanded - Succulents is an optional module for Vanilla Plants Expanded adding a variety of decorative plants, ideal to make your bases, houses, workstations and hospitals much prettier without having to maintain the flowerbeds. Succulents might provide only half of the beauty that flowers normally do, but their lifespan is three times as long, meaning your colonists won’t be forever busy with replacing flowers every few days.
            
               Succulents are inspired by real life succulents I have around my house, but for the purpose of the gameplay they have been unified stat-wise and simplified.
                  
                     This mod has been made by me and my girlfriend so you better watch your words! No one dare declare their love to me this time.
                        
                           I hope you will enjoy the mod, don’t hesitate to let me know what you think!

            Vanilla Apparel Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Weapons Expanded and Vanilla Armours Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days.
            
               Apparel is distributed into several new technologies that need to be researched, expanding the life of the game and possibly leading to some interesting choices - research a way to get off this planet? Or maybe learn how to craft jeans and workwear?
                  
                     This mod adds a wide selection of apparel with useful effects, including but not limited to:
                        Gas masks protecting from toxicity;
                           Jumpsuits and aprons for work speed boost;
                              Doctor scrubs and Chef’s uniforms.

            One thing I always wanted to do but never could bring myself to do is overhaul the Empire faction in the Royalty DLC. For such a mysterious, powerful entity in the political sphere of RimWorld, there is surprisingly little content around them. When I wanted to make a Royalty focused playthrough, I quickly realized it’s just a ‘normal playthrough’ with ‘royalty sprinkles’ - so not really what I wanted.
            
               So I did what I do best and sat down with my trusty google docs to design a complete overhaul to the Empire faction that will finally allow you to feel like a proper imperial nobility. From intrigues and art exhibitions, to hunting down deserters and protecting from the acts of terrorism, with this mod you can really make an Empire-centric playthrough and make a play for the Imperial throne.
                  
                     With new permits, structures, apparel, vassalage system, royal honors, Great Hierarchy and titles, this mod is a powerhouse for those wanting to roleplay as the Imperial family, but it will also work just as well for people who only want one or two nobles in their colony.
                        
                           For obvious reasons this mod requires Royalty DLC.

            Vanilla Textures Expanded is a full-scale overhaul of vanilla (unmodded) RimWorld textures, with its main aim being not only to fix less aesthetically pleasing textures, but also to bring vanilla aesthetic in-line with that of Vanilla Expanded mod series.
            
               This texture pack includes over 450 textures remade in vector-based software (same method used for Vanilla Expanded mods), exported into 2x the size of vanilla textures. What used to be blurred before, now will be sharp and crisp, even if zoomed in fully using mods by the likes of Camera+.
                  
                     When redrawing vanilla textures, our main focus was on keeping them consistent with what players are used to - don’t expect any drastic design changes - we have only changed the look of things that were really bad or ambiguous.
                        
                           We plan to keep adding new textures in the future, so make sure to let us know what particular textures in vanilla game require changes!

            With a brand new utility item code introduced in RimWorld 1.2 update, I saw it as a perfect fit to make grenades be actually useful instead of forcing you to choose between a grenade and a rifle. By crafting grenade belts, you can now equip all vanilla and vanilla expanded grenade types on your pawn alongside any weapon you wish, and use them manually by selecting a special “throw grenade” button on the menu, next to the draft button.
            
               You heard it right, now you can launch grenades and continue to fire your assault carbine at your enemies! No need to call out that single useless colonist that always carries just grenades.
                  
                     What’s the drawback? Grenades on the belt are limited, much like the ammo for the Grenadier suit in Royalty DLC, you now need to refill the grenades after the charges deplete. You refill them using the grenade type they are made out of - Frag grenade belt gets refilled with frag grenades etc.

            Vanilla Psycasts Expanded - Hemosage introduces a brand new Psycaster path that can be selected if Vanilla Psycasts Expanded is found - hemosage. A hemosage utilises the power of hemogen to control the battlefield, and the abilities are focused on magnifying the strength of a sanguophage.
            Hemosage has access to a number of new psycasts that consume hemogen instead of generating psychic heat. Initiate blood focus to rapidly regenerate psyfocus, lob blood shards and sanguine spears at your enemies, vomit a thick mist of blood at your enemies causing them to go into vomiting spree, or force your enemies to give you the offering of blood. At the final level, you can open the skipgates to the ancient sanguophage place, generating a downpour of blood, greatly enhancing your psycasting capabilities.
               With a new deathrest meditation focus, you can now build a meditation platform in your deathresting chambers, enhancing the XP gain of your psycaster.
                  Works perfectly with Vanilla Races Expanded - Sanguophage.
                     This mod requires Biotech DLC, as it relies on Sanguophages and Hemogen resource.

            Vanilla Skills Expanded is a new mod that expands on the vanilla skills system by introducing expertise to the extremely broad skill categories that vanilla has. Only 1 expertise per pawn can be gained. Expertise can only be gained in skills with both a passion and more than 15 levels. In addition, other mods can add more to account for their own additions of tasks.
            
               Expertise will allow your pawns to truly excel in specific skills that fit their abilities and backstories. From planet-known roofers and architects to professional chefs and master duelists, this mod aims to add much more character to all the pawns.
                  
                     Expertise is a permanent choice, so be careful what you pick!
                        
                           This mod also introduces three new passion types - critical passion, natural passion and apathy!

            "More Trait Slots" is a pretty simple mod. It doesn't add new traits to the game, but it will work well with mods that do, as it allows you to configure the minimum and maximum number of traits that pawns will start with. It also adjusts the character display tab so that up to seven (or up to nine with a smaller font) traits can actually be seen.
            
               - Rainbeau Flambe (dburgdorf)
                  
                     =====
                        
                           Compatibility:
                              
                                 "More Trait Slots" can safely be added to or deleted from a game in progress, and shouldn't conflict with any other mods.
                                    
                                       If you're using "EdB Prepare Carefully," you might see a warning message if you assign more traits to a pawn than the vanilla character tab would be able to display, but you can safely ignore that message. And you should have no other issues when using the two mods together.

        <Description>
            When I started looking for a mod to add more traits to the game, I quickly realized three things about the various trait collection mods that are available: they all have some traits I really like, but also some I dislike, and none of them had all the traits I wanted; they don't necessarily work very well together due to conceptual overlaps or conflicts; and some of them are buggy in one way or another.
            
               So I decided to deal with the problem by... releasing yet another trait collection mod. *Shrug* What can I say? This one, at least, has the traits I like, all the traits I like, and nothing but the traits I like. And I'm reasonably certain it's bug-free.
                  
                     "Consolidated Traits" adds 45 traits to the game, almost doubling the number of traits available for pawns. The new traits are:
                        
                           - "Aesthete": Pawns with this trait love beautiful things, and care a lot about the beauty of their environment.
                              - "Animal Hater": Some pawns just aren't "animal people."
                                 - "Animal Lover": Pawns with this trait, as you'd expect, are especially good at dealing with animals.
                                    - "Bipolar": Pawns with this trait will have more extreme mood swings than other pawns.
                                       - "Builder": Pawns with this trait are good at constructing things, at least if they have instructions.
                                          - "Butcher": Pawns with this trait are much faster when butchering animal corpses.
                                             - "Claustrophobic": Pawns who don't like confined spaces make poor miners.
                                                - "Cold Lover": Pawns with this trait will complain less when it's cold, but will whine more when it's hot.
                                                   - "Coordinated": This one provides a slight boost to global work speed and to most skilled labor.
                                                      - "Deadshot": This provides a boost to both shooting speed and accuracy.
                                                         - "Deep Sleeper": Pawns with this trait won't be disturbed by others while sleeping.
                                                            - "Dunce": Pawns with this trait will learn at a slower rate.
                                                               - "Glutton": Pawns with this trait eat very quickly.
                                                                  - "Gourmet": Pawns with this trait prepare excellent food, but take their time in doing so.
                                                                     - "Heat Lover": This is the counterpoint to "Cold Lover."
                                                                        - "Inept": This trait is the counterpoint to "Coordinated."

                                                                              - "Ironman"/"Tough"/"Low Pain Tolerance": These traits affect a pawn's pain tolerance.
                                                                                 - "Near-Sighted"/"Eagle-Eyed": These traits affect primarily a pawn's shooting accuracy.
                                                                                    - "Neat Freak": Pawns with this trait appreciate the importance of a dirt-free environment.
                                                                                       - "Nibbler": Pawns with this trait eat very slowly, picking at their food.
                                                                                          - "Nyctophobe"/"Nyctophile": These traits make pawns either more or less afraid of the dark than usual.
                                                                                             - "Perfectionist": Pawns with this trait try to make sure their work is done right, no matter how long it takes.
                                                                                                - "Poor Medic"/"Skilled Medic"/"Master Medic": These traits provide penalties or buffs to medical skills.
                                                                                                   - "Quick Learner": This trait is the counterpart to "Dunce."
                                                                                                      - "Rockhound": Pawns with this trait excel at mining and stonecutting, but are a bit slow at other tasks.
                                                                                                         - "Savant": Pawns with this trait are creative geniuses, but terribly slow workers.
                                                                                                            - "Sluggish"/"Swift Reflexes": These traits affect a pawn's ability to dodge attacks.
                                                                                                               - "Sucker"/"Haggler"/"Master Trader": These traits affect prices when a pawn is trading.
                                                                                                                  - "Uncouth"/"Diplomat"/"Master Diplomat": These traits affect the success of a pawn's diplomatic efforts.
                                                                                                                     - "Weak Constitution"/"Strong Constitution": These traits affect a pawn's resistance to pathogens and diseases.

                                                                                                                                       Compatibility:
                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                             "Consolidated Traits" should be compatible with most other mods. Even if those mods add similar traits, there shouldn't be any conflicts, as the traits are unlikely to have the same defNames. However, if you're using more than one mod that adds traits, you might end up seeing pawns with traits that don't really work well together, since the game won't have any way of knowing that trait X from mod Y duplicates or just isn't compatible with trait A from mod B.
                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                   I'd recommend using my "More Trait Slots" mod. Combining a larger pool of traits with a larger set of traits per pawn can add some very interesting and uniquely individual personalities to your game.
                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                         You should be able to add "Consolidated Traits" to an existing saved game without trouble, but removing the mod from a game in progress might cause problems if any pawns in the world have any of the mod's traits, which is of course very likely.

            These are flying caravans, meant to load people and cargo and bring it somewhere else -- potentially a very long distance, and back again. These act like drop pods, but are not one use -- when you bring it back home you choose where to land and disembark.
            
               Great for hauling cargo, trading with factions, assaulting points of interest on your world map, and so much more. Acts as both a caravan and a drop pod.
                  
                     A few additional role-specific short range transport shuttles (or SRTS) so you really can fly across the whole world and back again. All ships require their own research project, and they're not cheap. All passengers heal, rest, and eat while on board all transport shuttles, but some shuttles are easier than others to rest in.

                              - Multiplayer mod: You will not be able to actually load anything into the ship. It won't work. Sorry.

            Adds a single workbench for all prosthetics. This is mainly an enhancement to vanilla, however it supports all mods that use the fabricator and machining table. For example [FSF] Vanilla Bionics Expansion. Mods that have their own workbenches are generally not supported, mostly because there is no reason to.

Four tech versions (Medieval, Industrial, Spacer and Ultra) which can be researched after hospital beds (except for Medieval which is after Carpet Making). Note the items are best made in advance at a tailoring bench/crafting spot. Upon deconstruction it will return the base item used and using a crafting spot you can repack any uninstalled buildings to be rolled back up. Suggest using the mod "Pick up and haul".

Made from Ethyl mercury, Neutroamine and Rimoxicillin with the use of an industrial Med kit. The immunisation will either remove the “Sickly” trait from a colonist or will add the “Super-Immune” trait instead. It is provided in the form of a self-administered injection.

Being spacer tech it is made with Ultratech medicine, Neutroamine, Lithium Salts and Clarity. The injection will remove psychic susceptibility traits in stages, so hyper-sensitivity will require two injections.

The effects of transcendence are less random with the capability of ordering the applied qualities of knowledge and skills learned into more characteristic skill sets. However the amount gained is slightly less than that of a normal Neurotrainer.

            Adds new inspiration types:
            
               * Farming: increases planting speed by 200% and harvest chance by 75% (or harvest amount by 75% if you have a mod)
                  * Mining: increases mining speed by 200% and mining yield by 75%

                           Because these new inspirations dilute the inspiration pool so you will get the other inspirations less often, they have a higher minimum skill requirement so that you are more likely to get them only on your main pawns that use those skills. 
                              The skill requirements are 8.

            Reorganizes the trade UI into a two-column layout to make it clear what items the colony has vs trader has, who is trading, and how much it will cost.
            
               -Right-click on the "&lt;" and "&gt;" buttons to add max/min amount of items (like vanilla &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; buttons)
